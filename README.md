## Overview
This is a simple image classification git app trained on the top of Keras API. The trained model (`model.h5`) takes an image (which is drawn on the canvas) as an input and predict the class of image from 0-8.

## Motivation
What could be a perfect way to utilize an unfortunate lockdown period? Like most of you, I spend my time on  Netflix, Prime Video, coding, learning, reading some latest research papers on weekends. One day I was thinking that where we can Use The MNIST dataset. I got an idea where i can use this MNIST dataset efficiently.
So I made this Math-Garden app.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:



## Deployement on Heroku
Set the environment variable on Heroku as mentioned in _STEP 1_ in the __Run__ section. [[Reference](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)]

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.
