## Overview
This is a simple image classification git app trained on the top of Keras API. The trained model (`model.h5`) takes an image (which is drawn on the canvas) as an input and predict the class of image from 0-8.

## Motivation
What could be a perfect way to utilize an unfortunate lockdown period? Like most of you, I spend my time on  Netflix, Prime Video, coding, learning, reading some latest research papers on weekends. One day I was thinking that where we can Use The MNIST dataset. I got an idea where i can use this MNIST dataset efficiently.
So I made this Math-Garden app.
